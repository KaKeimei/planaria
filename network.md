# Beta

Currently Planaria Network is in Beta and the repository exists on a single server, because it's early stage and the Planaria project itself will probably need to go through several iterations of updates based on real world usage and feedback. 

When the "main net" launch happens, we will have at least the following:

1. **Registry on Bitcoin:** All Planaria code will be hosted on Bitcoin using file upload protocols such as [B://](https://b.bitdb.network)
2. **Monetization:** All Planaria nodes are tied to a Bitcoin address. The API access to Planaria nodes can be handled by Planaria.
3. **Security:** Deterministic keys, robust key management, etc.
